 * A character that would make the keyword part of a longer word: any Unicode

 * This replaces `\b`, which JavaScript defines as a boundary against
 * `[A-Za-z0-9_]` and does **not** widen under the `u` flag. For a keyword in
 * any non-Latin script both sides of the boundary are non-ASCII, so `\b` never
 * asserted and the match failed silently.

/**
 * Scripts written without spaces between words.
 *
 * A word boundary is not merely a weaker signal in these scripts — it does not
 * exist. `指南` inside `请发指南给我` is a normal, correct occurrence with a
 * letter hard against it on both sides, so requiring a boundary there rejects
 * every real comment. A character from one of these scripts therefore does not
 * count as swallowing the keyword into a longer word.
 *
 * The consequence is deliberate and worth stating: a Japanese keyword `ガイド`
 * also matches inside `ガイドライン`. That is the same trade-off
 * `KEYWORD_TOO_SHORT_MESSAGE` already warns about for short Latin keywords, and
 * the alternative — matching nothing at all — is the bug being fixed.
